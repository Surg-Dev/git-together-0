tony: No, that's wrong!
tony: If we approach this completely blindly, it may end in disaster, yes, 
tony: however, if we get stuck discussing semantics we'll never make anything!
tony: Let's make up a structure for some things like resources, management and a general game direction.
tony: Then we focus our energy on creating rather than arguing!
yellowaf: He's right. A game needs creating more than anything.
sahaun: I suppose you're right.
pope: Whatever gets you plebs working.
minty: Plebs?! What do you mean, plebs?
pope: Common folk! Infidels! Commoners! Proletariat! Sheep!
pope: Call yourselves whatever you like, just see to making that damned game already
pope: You have wasted far too much of my time.
math: Wait a minute, are you saying you won't participate?
pope: Participate? Me? Ahahaha! I am the pope!
pope: God's messenger! conqueror of discord! Master of delusion!
pope: How dare ye even think I should be involved in such lowly work as game development.
tony: But if you don't participate, we might not succeed in creating this game.
math: We'll need every participant we can have!
tony: If even just one person slacks off, we won't make it in tim-
yellowaf: I won't participate either
sahaun: What!?
tony: !!
math: !
minty: ?
yellowaf: A game needs more than just eager participants
yellowaf: It needs funding (and networking)
yellowaf: If you can't scrape together a reasonable pay to hire me, I'm afraid I won't be able to help
pope: Bwahaha, and what's a "reasonable pay" for a commoner such as yourself?
pope: $160 an hour? That's less than I spend on shaving cream!
minty: You shave?
pope: No
minty: So why do yo-
yellowaf: $250 actually
sahaun: $250!? Are you mad?
sahaun: How in the world are we to scrape together $250 x 16 x 7?
math: Do any of you even have money on you? I know I don't have any
tony: We were all gassed and brought here by surprise, I don't think anyo-
minty: I have $38700 actually
tony: What? How?
math: Careful, Tony, we don't have the full story. 
math: Minty, do you have that money with you right now
minty: No...
math: ...
