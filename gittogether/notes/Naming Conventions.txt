(Really basic at this point)

Your sprites/objects/scripts/room(s) for your minigames go into their separate groups, under the parent group "__ Minigame <Resources>".

Use a prefix unique to your minigame. For example, the prefix for my minigame "Basic1" is "B1". So my resources are named like this: sB1_Sprite, oB1_Object, rmB1_Room.
