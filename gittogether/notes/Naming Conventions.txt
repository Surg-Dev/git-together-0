Naming conventions for the jam:
- spr_sprite, obj_object, rm_room, snd_sound
- script_name
- instanceVariables
- var _localVariables
- global.GlobalVariables
- EnumName.value
- MACRO_NAME

Your sprites/objects/scripts/room(s) for your minigames go into their separate groups, under the parent group "__ Minigame <Resources>".

Use a prefix unique to your minigame. For example, the prefix for my minigame "Basic1" is "B1". So my resources are named like this: spr_B1_sprite, obj_B1_object, rm_B1_room.
