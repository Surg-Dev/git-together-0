OBJECTS GUIDE

	oController is a persistent background manager that keeps running
	
	oPlayerOverworld is the player object that SHOULD ONLY EXIST IN THE OVERWORLD ROOM
		Your minigames should have separate player objects
	
	oArcadeParent should parent all arcade machine objects
		So each arcade minigame machine should be a separate object, as a child of oArcadeParent

HOW TO CREATE A NEW ARCADE MINIGAME

	> Open scr_init
		Add a new entry in the arc enum
		
		Add entries for the arcade's sprite, room and name in their respective arrays
	
	> Create a new arcade machine object under the "Arcade Machines" Objects group
		You can create a sprite for it too, under the "Arcade Machines" Sprites group
		
		Make sure to make the arcade object a child of "oArcadeParent"
		
		Set its type in the Create event, using the arc enum
		
		Place it in the overworld room
		
		If you want a custom transition, set "trans = TransType.<transition>".
		Default is "TransType.screenFade".
		You can also set custom color to your transition, using "transCol = <col>".
		Default is "c_black".
		For more types, see "Type" in "Room Transition" Note.
	
	> Create a room for your minigame, under "__ Minigame Rooms"
		This room will open when you select your arcade machine, if you set it in the array in scr_init for your arcade type
	
	> You can start adding your sprite/object resources under the "__ Minigame <Resources>" group of a resource
		Make sure to create a separate group for your minigame under the "__ Minigame <Resources>" group

IN YOUR MINIGAME

	When your minigame ends, use end_minigame() to come back to the overworld.
